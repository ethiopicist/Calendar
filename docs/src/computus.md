# Computus (ባሕረ፡ ሐሳብ)

Since the constants used in the Computus (i.e., the calculation of Easter) are used in the dating of manuscripts and it is useful to know the dates of the moveable feasts of a given year, the app also includes a table (known as the ባሕረ፡ ሐሳብ - "Sea of Computation").

The table will always show the current year selected in the calendar plus the 9 years before and after, resulting in a 19-year table (which is a full cycle).

Clicking on a date in the table will highlight it in the calendar.
