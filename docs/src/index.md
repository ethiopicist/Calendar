# Documentation

**Ḥassāba Zaman** is a free, open-source calendar application focused on the Ethiopian/Eritrean (or, Ethiopic) calendar.

The application aims to provide a wide range of features, including alternate calendars (Julian/Gregorian/Islamic), a tool for converting dates, and an automatically generated computus table (*Bāḥra Ḥassāb*), and customizations, including the ability to choose from a numer of languages or to use transliterated characters.

The idea behind having so many options for customization is to ensure that the application is as user-friendly as possible without sacrificing mathematical or linguistic accuracy and precision. It should be equally accessible to tourists visiting Ethiopia and to academics working with precise historical dates.
