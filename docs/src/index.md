# Documentation

**拷바ss캐ba Zaman** is a free, open-source calendar application focused on the Ethiopian/Eritrean (or, Ethiopic) calendar. It works even without an internet connection and can be installed as an app on your phone or tablet (simply "Add to Home Screen").

The goals of the app are (1) to be accessible to a wide range of users, (2) to be accurate both in terms of date calculations and in terms of language, and (3) to support a number of commonly desired features (e.g. conversion of dates between calendars). The app should be so intuitive that a tourist visiting Ethiopia could use it, while also accurate enough for a historian to use.
