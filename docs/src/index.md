# Documentation

**Ḥassāba Zaman** is a free, open-source calendar application focused on the Ethiopian/Eritrean (or, Ethiopic) calendar. It aims to provide a wide range of features, including alternate calendars (Julian/Gregorian/Islamic), a tool for converting dates, and an automatically generated computus table (*Bāḥra Ḥassāb), and customizations, including the ability to choose from a numer of languages or to use transliterated characters. The idea behind having so many options for customization is to ensure that the application is as user-friendly as possible, though it does so without sacrificing mathematical or linguistic accuracy and precision. The application should be as accessible to foreign tourists visiting Ethiopia as it is to academics working with historical dates.
